# CI Pipeline - Runs on every push and pull request
# This workflow builds and tests the application

name: CI

# When to run this workflow
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]      # Run on pushes to main
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]      # Run on PRs targeting main

jobs:
  # Job 1: Build and Test
  build:
    name: Build & Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest    # Use Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout code from repository
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Setup Node.js environment
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'          # Cache npm dependencies for faster builds

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci              # 'ci' is faster and stricter than 'npm install'

      # Step 4: Run linter to check code quality
      - name: Lint code
        run: npm run lint

      # Step 5: Build the application
      - name: Build application
        run: npm run build

      # Step 6: Upload build artifacts (optional - for debugging)
      - name: Upload build output
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: nextjs-build
          path: .next/
          retention-days: 7

  # Job 2: Security Check (runs parallel to build)
  security:
    name: Security Audit
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run security audit
        run: npm audit --audit-level=high
        continue-on-error: true   # Don't fail build on audit warnings
